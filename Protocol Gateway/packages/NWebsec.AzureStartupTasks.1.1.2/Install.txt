The scripts included in this package are intended to be run as startup tasks in
Windows Azure roles, and it is recommended to install them through NuGet.
If installation through NuGet install is not an option, the scripts can be
added to an ASP.NET project by hand. The scripts are also useful to system
administrators managing Windows Server 2008 R2/2012 (they require PowerShell 2).

*** Configuring the Azure startup tasks by hand *** 
Copy the "NWebsec.AzureStartupTasks" directory with contents to the root of
your ASP.NET project. Make sure that the .cmd and .ps1 files have
"Copy to output directory" set to "Copy Always" in their properties. Refer to
the "NWebsec.AzureStartupTasks/ReadMe.txt" file for details on how to
configure your Azure project to run the startup tasks.

*** Running the scripts directly (for system administrators) *** 
If you want to run the scripts directly, use the PowerShell scripts found in
the "NWebsec.AzureStartupTasks/scripts" folder. The .cmd scripts are specific
to Azure, and should only be used as Azure startup tasks.
